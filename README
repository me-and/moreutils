This is a collection of the unix tools that nobody thought to write
long ago, when unix was young. Currently it consists of these tools:

chronic: runs a command quietly unless it fails
combine: combine the lines in two files using boolean operations
errno: look up errno names and descriptions
ifdata: get network interface info without parsing ifconfig output
isutf8: check if a file or standard input is utf-8
ifne: run a command if the standard input is not empty
lckdo: execute a program with a lock held (deprecated)
mispipe: pipe two commands, returning the exit status of the first
parallel: run multiple jobs at once
pee: tee standard input to pipes
sponge: soak up standard input and write to a file
ts: timestamp standard input
vidir: edit a directory in your text editor
vipe: insert a text editor into a pipe
zrun: automatically uncompress arguments to command

Its web page is here: http://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/

This collection is closed at this time for suggestions of additional tools
to add to it. The web page lists a bunch that have been suggested,
and I have a mailbox full of others. Sorry to all who have sent
contributions without a reply. 

If you would like to take up editorial responsibility for adding tools, as
well as take over maintenance of moreutils, please contact me. In the
meantime, this project is still being maintained by me, and patches and
suggestions for improvements to exsting tools is still welcome.
